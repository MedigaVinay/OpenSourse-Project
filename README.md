# OpenSourse-Project
Using desired Open Source Software display an overview of all the hardware and operating  system detail; also do live monitoring to show the temperature and current usage of various  hardware components

Heare we vca use mainly 3 commands 
They are i)lshw
         ii)lm-sensors
“lshw”-It is a small command-line utility that provides detailed information on the hardware configuration of the machine.
“lm-sensors”-This tool that provides monitoring of the hardware sensors, including temperature sensors, voltage sensors, and fan speed sensors.
"lshw -short"-This command will output a summary of the hardware configuration, including the CPU, memory, Storage devices, network interfaces, and more
